Andres: My name is Andres Villa, Im from Los Angeles California and I currently am in my living room. Im sitting here with my Mom, Claudia Castillo. 

Andres: When and where were you born?

Claudia: I was born in San Salvador, El Salvador on March 3, 1978

Andres: Where did you grow up?

Claudia: I grew up in Koreatown here in LA.

Andres: What was your childhood like?

Claudia: I grew up super religious, so I didn’t know anything else, but I had a lot of good people around me that looked out for me all the time. 

Andres: What is your ethnic background?

Claudia: Both of my parents are from El Salvador, but I have a trace of spaniard descendants in my dna. 

Andres: Where is your mom's family from? 

Claudia: Unfortunately our family is not as united as other families are, so I wouldn’t be able to tell you but I just know that they are from El Salvador. 

Andres: What’s one important lesson that you remember? 

Claudia: That you gotta let people live and let them do their thing. 

Andres: What is a moment of history that you personally remember? 

Claudia: When Ronald Reagan was elected as president? 

Andres: Did you not like him as a president? 

Claudia: No it’s just that there was a lot of controversy in the 80’s at that time. 

Andres: Ok, last one. How has your life been different than what you imagined it to be. 

Claudia: It’s different because I had gotten married and had kids, I settled down and I thought I was going to be backpacking the world.
