<p><center><font color="black">I chose the images that I chose was because I really thought that those photo’s described my interviewee. Like for example, the picture of the basketball players were there because the lakers were my interviewee’s favorite basketball team. Another reason why I chose those pictures were because my interviewee mentioned it in the interview. For example, my interviewee said that she remembered when Ronald Reagan was elected as president, so I added a photo of Ronald Reagan. Some images connect to my interviewee and a historical moment was when 9/11 happened and how it affected the whole United States, although I didn’t add a photo of 9/11 because the images were disturbing and people could have taken it the wrong way but it was in my interview. My composition for images were simple. The pictures that only represented my mom as a person were about medium to tall size, but the images that were said in the interview were medium to small because those pictures really don’t describe my mom/interviewee as a person. For example the picture of Ronald Reagan wasn’t that big because I didn’t want my viewer to think that my interviewee liked Ronald Reagan as a president, because she didn’t, but wanted my viewers to know that she liked to listen to music, which is the reason why I put a picture of someone listening to music. The pictures were friendly pictures such as flowers, hearts, and pictures of my interviewee’s hometown and the Salvadorian flag. Also I made some other pictures smaller because it was just the history part of the portrait and wasn’t that part of who my interviewee was.</font></p>
